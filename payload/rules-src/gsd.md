# GSD / Superpowers routing

Loads only in repos that have a `.planning/` directory (GSD project). Irrelevant elsewhere —
do not duplicate this in the global `CLAUDE.md`.

GSD here is the `open-gsd/gsd-core` fork. Claude Code command form is hyphenated: `/gsd-*`
(the colon form `/gsd:*` is Gemini-only). Pipeline: discuss -> plan -> execute -> verify ->
ship. Artifacts live in `.planning/`.

## Precedence: GSD owns the pipeline when `.planning/` exists

- Drive ALL phase work through explicit `/gsd-*` commands. Do NOT invoke Superpowers skills
  for discovery, planning, execution, TDD, debugging, or code review here — they orphan
  output from GSD's artifact chain, and their interactive prompts stall GSD's execute stream.
- Map: discovery -> `/gsd-discuss-phase` (or `/gsd-explore`); plan -> `/gsd-plan-phase`;
  build -> `/gsd-execute-phase`; review -> `/gsd-code-review`; verify -> `/gsd-verify-work`;
  ship -> `/gsd-ship`; debug -> `/gsd-debug`.
- Reason: GSD's value is the persisted, context-isolated artifact chain. Each phase output
  is the next phase's input; cherry-picking one phase out of the loop loses that chain.

## GSD orchestrator token hygiene

- In `/gsd-plan-phase` and `/gsd-execute-phase` orchestrator threads, route exploratory /
  data-derivation Bash and Read calls (JSON parsing, path/config lookups, file
  summarization) through `ctx_batch_execute` / `ctx_execute` / `ctx_execute_file` instead
  of raw `Bash`/`Read`.
- Do not reroute `gsd_run()` / `gsd-tools.cjs` protocol calls (gate checks, commit
  validation, drift precheck, worktree checks) through the sandbox — gsd-core drives its
  own control flow off their literal exit codes/stdout.
- Keep the orchestrator thread itself on sonnet-5, not opus. Opus stays reserved for
  planning/research/verification roles.
- `TaskCreate`/`TaskUpdate` have no batch parameter — don't try to batch them.
- GSD subagents get the same routing rule directly in their own prompt file (a
  `<context_mode_routing>` block, applied by `hooks/lib/gsd-agent-patches.mjs` /
  `/init-session`) rather than through this snapshot — subagents never read the
  project's compiled `stack-rules.md`, so a prose rule living only here would be dead
  weight for them.

## Superpowers is retained only for gaps GSD does not fill

- Skill authoring (no GSD equivalent).
- Greenfield Socratic brainstorm BEFORE a GSD project exists (no `.planning/` yet). Once
  scope is clear, hand off to `/gsd-new-project` and stop using Superpowers for that work.

## Worktrees: single owner

- GSD owns worktrees (`/gsd-workspace`, execute waves). Superpowers' aggressive auto-worktree
  skill is shadowed by a no-op `using-git-worktrees/SKILL.md` in `~/.claude/skills/` (user
  scope wins over plugin cache).
- Two worktree creators collide and fail silently outside a git repo. `git init` before any
  phase.

## TDD / debug / code-review: never double-gate

- One enforcer per repo. GSD owns these via `.planning/config.json` (`tdd_mode`, code-review
  toggles) — set them deliberately; do not let Superpowers TDD/debug skills fire alongside.
- Before looking for the root of a problem/error in dependencies, check if there's an
  alternative solution. If there is, suggest it. If not, search for the root.

## CLAUDE.md quarantine (critical)

GSD generates a `CLAUDE.md`: `/gsd-new-project` produces one, `/gsd-profile-user` adds a
profile section. At PROJECT scope it outweighs the user file on conflict, so it must never
become authoritative. A project `CLAUDE.md` may live in the root OR in `.planning/`, and
either location may hold a human-curated file or GSD's generated one — authority is decided
by the marker, never by the path:

- HARD: the PreToolUse hook denies Write/Edit to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and to ANY `CLAUDE.md`
  carrying `CURATED:NOEDIT`, wherever it lives. Unmarked generated files stay editable.
- CURATION: a curated file's first line is `<!-- CURATED:NOEDIT -->`. A SessionStart hook
  auto-marks an unmarked project-root `CLAUDE.md` once per project (unless it looks
  GSD-generated; opt out with `CLAUDE_CURATED_AUTOMARK_ROOT=0`). Mark files in other locations
  by hand. Never add the marker to a GSD-generated file.
- WEIGHTED: if generated content is wanted, import it EARLY in the curated file with
  `@<path>/CLAUDE.md` — curated rules read later carry more weight on conflict.
- OPTIONAL (per-project): if a project's `.planning/CLAUDE.md` is GSD-owned and unwanted at
  load, add `claudeMdExcludes: ["**/.planning/CLAUDE.md"]` to THAT project's
  `.claude/settings.json`. Do NOT set this globally — union-excludes cannot be undone
  per-project and would hide a curated `.planning/CLAUDE.md`.
- Treat any unexpected diff to a curated `CLAUDE.md` as an Open risk in `RISK_REGISTER.md`.

## "graphify" is two tools sharing one CLI — don't confuse their graphs

- GSD's `/gsd-graphify` is gated by TWO independent booleans in `.planning/config.json`:
  `graphify.enabled` (unlocks the command; the skill refuses to run otherwise) and
  `graphify.auto_update` (post-commit auto-rebuild; defaults `false`). Neither flag builds
  anything — `.planning/graphs/` stays empty until `/gsd-graphify build` runs once. If
  `graph.json` is missing despite `enabled: true`, check whether a build ever ran.
- `build` is not a separate engine: it runs the standalone CLI as `graphify update .`
  (refreshing the project's own `graphify-out/` in place if it exists), then copies
  `graph.json`/`graph.html`/`GRAPH_REPORT.md` into `.planning/graphs/` plus GSD's own
  snapshot/status files. `.planning/graphs/` = GSD's copy of current `graphify-out/`.
- Auto-refresh (`hooks/gsd-graphify-update.sh`, PostToolUse on `Bash`) fires only after a
  HEAD-advancing git op on the default branch, outside CI, with BOTH flags true — detaches
  a PID-locked background rebuild (same update+copy). GSD's planning agents read
  `.planning/graphs/graph.json` directly — it's load-bearing, not a side artifact.
- GSD never touches the GLOBAL cross-project graph (`~/.graphify/global-graph.json`) — no
  config key targets it. It's kept fresh solely by `hooks/graphify-global-sync.mjs` + the
  native per-repo `post-commit` hook installed by `session-init.mjs`.
- A project's local `graphify-out/` has no auto-refresh of its own, and no prescriptive
  refresh-cadence rule is injected into the project's `CLAUDE.md` — run `graphify update .`
  manually when you want it current (a standing "consult the graph" nudge here would
  duplicate graphify's own `graphify claude install` CLAUDE.md section — see the note at
  the top of this subsection).

## `.planning/config.json` — default model_profile is auto-patched once per project

- `~/.claude/hooks/gsd-config-patch.mjs` (PostToolUse on `Write|Edit|MultiEdit|Bash`)
  overwrites ONLY the `model_profile` / `models` / `model_overrides` keys with a personal
  default set (`model_profile: "adaptive"`) the first time it sees `.planning/config.json`
  for a project; every other key gsd-core wrote is left untouched. One-time per project
  (tracked in `~/.claude/state/project-init.json`), so it never fights a later manual edit.
  Opt out: `CLAUDE_GSD_CONFIG_AUTOPATCH=0`. Rationale for the trigger surface and the
  per-agent override values lives in that hook's own header.
- Before relying on the exact `model_overrides` agent-name list, confirm `open-gsd/gsd-core`
  is the fork actually installed — verify tooling identity from what's installed, not from
  web content alone.
